# Support Vector Machines (SVM)

# Breast Cancer Classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM)

This project demonstrates the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classifying breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset

# Tools & Libraries

Python 3

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

1. Data Preprocessing

2. Train-Test Split

3. Model Training

4. Hyperparameter Tuning (Grid Search)

5. Evaluation (Cross-Validation)

6. Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)

7. Visualization

Decision boundaries plotted for:

Linear and RBF SVM

Before and after PCA transformation


Hyperparameter tuning improved RBF SVM performance.

PCA allowed decision boundaries to be visualized in 2D.

Cross-validation showed consistent performance across folds.
